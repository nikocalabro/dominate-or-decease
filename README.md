## Description

A multiplayer PvP turn based combat game, using spells and attacks to remove your opponents 
from the board. 2-6 players can choose between nine different classes, allowing them to have 
different attacks and change their gameplay every time. Whether that be trying to heal, run away, power 
up one's special move, or just go straight for the K.O. Each class also have a unique character design, including voicelines.
The list is as follows: Artificer, Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Ranger, Rogue, and Wizard.
The board is made out of seven hexagon tiles, making the middle tile open to attacks on all six sides. 
Each tile is unique, making positioning one of the most important aspects to winning the game. This is a game of intensive stratgey, starting from choosing
which class to pick. However, while the game focuses on the many different game plans, the winner might just
be decided on who is the luckiest.

### Dice

We made 3 different types of dice to accommodate:
<ul>
  <li>1d2, 2d2, 3d2</li>
  <li>1d4, 2d4, 3d4</li>
  <li>1d6, 2d6, 3d6</li>
</ul>
Players can click the dice on their turn for a dice rolling (or coin flipping) animation, resulting in a random 
combination of numbers. Each attack form each character rolls different dice and of different amounts.
